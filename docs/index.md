# SSE Documentation

## What is SSE?
Symmetric Searchable Encryption (SSE) is one of the modern cryptographic approaches that allows users to efficiently search over a collection of encrypted files without compromising the original data security.

## A concrete application for SSE
SSE is applied in ***Advanced Secure Cloud Encrypted Platform for Internationally Orchestrated Solutions (ASCLEPIOS)*** to build a cloud-based eHealth framework that protects usersâ€™ privacy and prevents both internal and external attacks. ASCLEPIOS is to maximize and fortify the trust of users on cloud-based healthcare services by developing mechanisms for protecting both corporate and personal sensitive data.
